# SPACE FUN 
The goal of the project was to create a mobile application that uses the APIs provided by NASA (e.g. MAAS or APOD) and Open Notify. The app was written using Flutter.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter** 


## Features
- NASA PHOTO OF THE DAY - To implement this functionality, we used the api provided by NASA - APOD. This api provides information on the "photo of the day" selected by NASA since June 16, 1995, and is updated daily. 
- PHOTOS FROM MARS = To implement this functionality, we used the api provided by NASA - Mars Rover Photos.  The api was designed to collect image data collected by NASA's Perserverance, Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it easily accessible to other developers, educators and citizen scientists.
- ISS DETAILS - We have divided this feature into two parts: "People on ISS" and "Where is ISS". For implementation, we used the Open Notify api provided by Open Notify. To display the location of the ISS we also used the Google Maps api. 
- MARS WEATHER - Using an api developed by NASA, we download meteorological data reported straight from the Curiosity rover. The information is made available from the beginning of the mission and counted in salts. We display the measurements in groups in the range selected by the user.
- DARK MODE
